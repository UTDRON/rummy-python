1) Find best cards to throw
2) Implement a gameplay simulator between 2-3 players,
    with provision for 1 deck or two decks if required based on the number of players playing
3) Implement pile class
4) generate a probability model for all cards based on cards thrown and cards drawn from pile 
5) Based on 4 and 3, find best cards to throw
6) Implement case for showing cards when your game is complete
7) Implement case for submitting cards with lowest sum when another player shows and finishes the game,
           
9) check for long break sequence houses for cases like 7.
    For example: 8S,...,...,11S. Attach two unused wildcards in between.
10) Evaluate cards that can satisfy your needs, and find the probability of 
    increasing your number of complete melds and decreasing reward sum based on "probability model discussed in 4"  

8) Attach multiple unused wildcards to 1 card for reducing the total reward sum
